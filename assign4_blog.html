        <h1>Assignment 4 - 11/20/2023</h1>
        <h3>Question 1: What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. 
            How did you solve those problems?</h3>
        <p>I struggled with quite a bit for this assignment mostly due to not knowing why my css and javascript files
            weren't being applied to my page. After sleeping on the problem and walking through all the steps I realized
            that I needed to have request handlers for those specific files in addition to my html pages.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Question 2: What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h3>
        <p>I feel like I learned a lot about routing pages in nodejs and what all needs to be handled by the server.</p><br>
        <h3>Question 3: What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) 
            were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h3>
        <p>The most helpful resources in this assignment were the hints in the assignment readme file and in class notes.</p><br>
        <h3>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
        <p>I tried googling to figure out why my css and javascript weren't being applied but my searching wasn't very helpful
            and most advice was to just use express.
