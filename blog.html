        <h2>Assignment 1 - 10/17/2023</h2>
        <h3>Question 1: What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h3>
        <p>Most of my struggles were with committing and pushing changes with git. I haven't used git before and after looking 
            through the resources a bit and doing everything a few times I feel like I'm now somewhat comfortable with commiting 
            and pushing changes using git.</p><br>
        <h3>Question 2: What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h3>
        <p>I already knew most of the HTML information needed to complete this assignment so I 
            used it as an opportunity to get used to git.</p><br>
        <h3>Question 3: What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) 
            were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h3>
        <p>The lecture notes and links to information on how to set up SSH keys and use git in 
            general were the most helpful for me.</p><br>

        <h2>Assignment 2 - 10/30/2023</h2>
        <h3>Question 1: What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you
             solve those problems?</h3>
        <p>A couple of the challenging aspects of this assignment were getting the product images to be the correct size and 
            using flexboxes in general. I used lecture notes and online resources to understand how to do these things.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Question 2: What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you 
            already knew?</h3>
        <p>I learned the most about flexboxes and content alignment by doing this assingment. I already knew how to change colors 
            and adjust sizes of elements.</p><br>
        <h3>Question 3: What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class
             Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h3>
        <p>I used online resources like stack overflow and w3schools when I didn't know how to do something in addition to reviewing
             lecture notes.</p><br>
        <h3>Question 4: What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
        <p>I had to google flexboxes and image sizing.</p><br>
