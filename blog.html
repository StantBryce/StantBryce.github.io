        <h2 class="title">Assignment 1 - 10/17/2023</h2>
        <h3>Question 1: What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h3>
        <p>Most of my struggles were with committing and pushing changes with git. I haven't used git before and after looking 
            through the resources a bit and doing everything a few times I feel like I'm now somewhat comfortable with commiting 
            and pushing changes using git.</p><br>
        <h3>Question 2: What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h3>
        <p>I already knew most of the HTML information needed to complete this assignment so I 
            used it as an opportunity to get used to git.</p><br>
        <h3>Question 3: What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) 
            were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h3>
        <p>The lecture notes and links to information on how to set up SSH keys and use git in 
            general were the most helpful for me.</p><br>
