        <h1>Assignment 3 - 11/13/2023</h1>
        <h3>Question 1: What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. 
            How did you solve those problems?</h3>
        <p>The most challenging aspect of this assignment has to be filtering the posts. Learning how to access values and element features 
            was a learning proccess but the hardest part I faced was removing posts from the DOM while maintaining the refiltering 
            functionality. My initial method of searching for elements sharing a class and storing them in an array failed due to the 
            stored values being removed from the array when they were removed from the DOM. I solved this issue by useing a query which 
            stores values statically meaning that when they're updated in the DOM they don't change in the array.</p><br>
        <h3>Question 2: What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h3>
        <p>DOM manipulation was something I knew a bit about already but this assignment helped solidify knowledge and presented problems 
            I hadn't faced before.</p><br>
        <h3>Question 3: What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) 
            were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h3>
        <p>The most helpful resources I used were notes taken in class in addition to websites like stackoverflow.com which helped me 
            figure out that finding elements by class stores the elements dynamically as opposed to statically which was what I wanted.</p><br>
        <h3>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
        <p>I had to google how to determine all of the checkboxes that were checked before it was discussed in class. As stated above I 
            also had to google why elements were being removed from my array after being removed from the DOM.</p><br>
